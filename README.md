# iPhoneX

Install Chromedriver

Force refresh apple.com to get a notification when the iPhoneX buying page is not unavailable anymore.

When the website recoveryed, you can know at no time wasted.

I could order one iPhoneX which says that you can get after 3-4 weeks, but I give up, cause I haven't use the fully function of my iPhone 6s Plus.

Wait for more time, hmm.
